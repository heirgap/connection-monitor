# network-monitor

This tool monitors your connection by sending periodic pings out to a host(1.1.1.1) by default), triggers a Windows toast notification when connection is lost and displays current latency in the Windows taskbar. Saves a log file on a local server via SSH, which can be recalled by graph.py to display a scatter plot in the web browser.
