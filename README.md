# network-monitor

This tool monitors your connection by sending periodic pings out to a host(8.8.8.8 by default), triggers a Windows toast notification when connection is lost and displays current latency in the Windows taskbar.

Use case includes WFM situations where connection is critical. This tool allows you to monitor and stay on top of your network connection.
