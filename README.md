# network-monitor

This tool monitors your connection by sending periodic pings out to a host(1.1.1) by default), triggers a Windows toast notification when connection is lost and displays current latency in the Windows taskbar. Saves a log file on a local server via SSH, which can be recalled by graph.py to display a scatter plot in the web browser.

Use case includes WFM situations where connection is critical. This tool allows you to monitor and stay on top of your network connection.
